# DRT Survey

We conducted a bilingual survey aimed at gathering information, based on experts' feedback, regarding the utilization of DRT methods and software in analyzing EIS measurements. The primary objective of this 
survey is to gain insights into the requirements and preferences of experimentalists, engineers, and professionals concerning DRT methods and software. Additionally, we seek to understand the needs for further enhancements. 

This survey is a crucial component of our ongoing efforts to write a perspective article that highlights the need for developing new automated DRT frameworks, surpassing existing software tools, each with its strengths and limitations, as discussed in Section 4 of the article. These developments can significantly contribute to expediting material discovery, potentially expanding DRT applications across various disciplines, and promoting interdisciplinary synergies.
