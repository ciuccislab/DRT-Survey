# DRT Survey

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a commonly employed characterization technique for studying electrochemical systems like batteries and fuel cells [1,2,3]. The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) has become a versatile alternative to equivalent circuits and physical models in EIS data analysis [1-8]. Despite its versatility, deconvolving the DRT from EIS spectra poses challenges, leading to the development of various approaches for this purpose [2-8]. In order to advance the field of DRT-based EIS analysis, we conducted a bilingual survey (English and Chinese) to gather perspectives from experts, shedding light on its current usage and outlining several opportunities for future directions to expand the DRT field. Informed by our survey findings, we identified specific challenges related to DRT-based EIS data analysis and interpretations, proposing solutions that significantly enhance the DRT domain and expand its application in impedance analysis. 

In summary, our survey has helped lay a future roadmap for developing the DRT field by highlighting the need for automated DRT deconvolution and the automatic association of peaks with processes. This advanced software tool would surpass existing software tools, each with its strengths and limitations (as discussed in Section 4 of the main article).

Starting with EIS data, the DRT is deconvolved, which results in the identification of timescales, subsequent analysis allows the identification of the corresponding electrochemical processes.
